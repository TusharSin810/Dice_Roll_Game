# ðŸŽ²Dice_Roll_GameðŸŽ²

Welcome to the Dice-Roll game, designed for up to four players to enjoy together. Players can claim a dice by entering their names, which persist throughout the session even after page refreshes. The game uses JavaScript to handle player interactions, dice rolling mechanics, and dynamic result announcements. Each roll displays a random dice image to simulate different outcomes, and the game declares the winner of each round or if it's a draw.

Features:

1) Player Interaction: Enter player names to claim a dice.
2) Dynamic Dice Rolling: Random dice images simulate game outcomes.
3) Winner Announcement: Real-time display of round winners or draws.
4) CSS Design: Clean and effective styling using CSS.
5) JavaScript Functionality: All game mechanics are implemented with JavaScript for seamless user experience.


This project showcases basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills in a simple and interactive game format. Ideal for learning the basics of front-end web development and JavaScript DOM manipulation.
